# Science Accidentally Proves That Demons Might Be Real

*A Myscrie Original*

---

### 🎙️ [INTRO – Hook | 0:00–0:20]

> *“You believe in Wi-Fi, don’t you?*  
> *You trust your phone to send invisible signals through the air — across oceans — into someone else’s mind.*  
> *But what if something darker rides those same waves?*  
> *Not technology… but presence. Not a glitch… but something ancient — intelligent — and watching.”*

> **This is Myscrie.**  
> **And today, we follow science into a place it was never meant to go — a place that might prove demons are real.**

### 🧪 [PART 1 – THE EYE CAN’T SEE EVERYTHING | 0:20–1:20]

> You only see **0.0035%** of the electromagnetic spectrum.  
> That means 99.9965% of reality… is invisible to you.

> We can’t see Wi-Fi. Or radio. Or infrared.  
> But they’re there — moving through your room, your body, your mind — right now.

> And that’s just physics.

> Some researchers have captured **shadow-like figures** on surveillance cameras — shapes that dart past at impossible speeds.  
> In Fresno, California, a shadow crossed a warehouse in a single frame. Some say “glitch.” Others say we caught something the eye was never meant to see.

> If reality hides that much… what else is moving through the dark?

### ⚛️ [PART 2 – EINSTEIN, ENERGY, AND SOMETHING BEYOND | 1:20–2:30]

> Einstein’s equation — E = mc² — means that **mass and energy are interchangeable.**

> But here’s the twist:  
> **The faster something moves, the more it becomes energy.**

> So at the speed of light… matter dissolves.  
> But what if something *starts* on the other side?  
> A being made of pure energy. Not solid. Not physical. Not limited.

> It wouldn’t walk into a room — it would **phase** into it.  
> Not seen… but felt.  
> Like cold air before a storm. Like static before a voice.

> Science tells us this is possible. It just never asks what *else* might do it.

### 🌊 [PART 3 – VIBRATION, QUANTUM LEAKS, AND DOORLESS ENTRY | 2:30–3:40]

> Quantum physics shows us something terrifying:  
> **Particles can disappear… and reappear on the other side of solid matter.**  
> It’s called *quantum tunneling* — and it’s proven.

> One second, it’s here. The next, it’s through the wall.

> If particles can do it… could something *else*?

> And here’s where it gets stranger:  
> Reality isn’t solid — it’s made of vibrations.  
> Matter is just energy, vibrating at a specific frequency.

> If something knew how to control its vibration,  
> it could slip through our world like **fog through a fence**.

> You wouldn’t see it.  
> But your instincts would scream.

### 🧠 [PART 4 – HUMAN CONNECTION: HOW YOU BECOME THE GATEWAY | 3:40–4:40]

> It gets personal now.

> Ancient spiritual systems — and quantum theories — speak of the **Law of Connection**.  
> That everything… is linked.  
> Your mind is not isolated. Your thoughts ripple into something greater.

> Focus is a tuning fork.  
> And the more you focus on something — fear it, imagine it, believe it —  
> the more you **tune in to it**.

> You don’t need rituals.  
> Or pentagrams.  
> Sometimes, all it takes is your attention.

> You invite it… by simply noticing it.

### 👁️ [PART 5 – DMT, ENTITIES, AND THE UNSEEN NETWORK | 4:40–6:00]

> Here's where science cracks open the door.

> In government-approved studies on DMT — the most powerful known psychedelic — participants report *the same thing*:

> **Entities. Beings. Watchers.**

> Dr. Rick Strassman’s clinical research saw subjects — strangers — describing the same shapes, colors, messages, even emotions.  
> Some called them divine.  
> Others said they were tested, judged… or warned.

> These weren’t hallucinations.  
> These were consistent, structured *encounters*.  
> Across beliefs. Across cultures. Across time.

> Could these be fragments of a broken brain?

> Or… are these the very entities ancient texts once called demons —  
> but science now meets… through chemistry?

### 🧩 [ENDING – THE PIECES FIT | 6:00–6:40]

> You were never meant to see them.  
> Not with your eyes.

> But science — unknowingly — is tearing back the curtain.  
> Piece by piece. Experiment by experiment.  
> Showing us:
> 
> - Beings can exist without form.
> 
> - They can move without mass.
> 
> - And they may not need permission to enter.

> So the question isn’t “Are demons real?”

> The question is:  
> **If science keeps peeling back reality… what else is standing just behind it?**

### 🎬 [OUTRO – Branding | 6:40–7:00]

> This is **Myscrie** — where the unknown meets the undeniable.

> If you feel like something’s watching… maybe you’re just *finally looking in the right direction.*

> Subscribe. Stay alert.  
> And remember —  
> **Some truths hide because we’re not ready to see them.**
